# Graph
## Author Harry Nguyen (created 08/01/2023)

Graph is one of the most important data structure, which is used to solve many trivial practical problems. Indeed, Grpah can be represented in 2 ways: adjacent list and adjacent matrix, each of which has its own pros and cons. Adjacent list is more preferable with graph that has fewer edges than vertices, while adjacent matrix should be used when the graph is much more dense.

In this project, I have build a class of graph, whose each vertex contains an integer, using adjacent list. Besides, I also add many different famous algorithms used for Graph, such as Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, Floyd Warshall to find the shortest path from one vertext to others, Prim and Kruskal to find the minimum spanning tree, Kosaraju to find the SCC, or Ford Fulkerson to find the maximum flow in the network.
